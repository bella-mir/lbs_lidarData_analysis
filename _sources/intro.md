This project aims to analyze and visualize moving objects at the intersection using data from a LiDAR Multiple Object Tracking system. The provided data is raw and includes trajectory points with additional attributes such as speed, length, width, and height.

The main objectives are:

- interactive exploration of the dataset
- identification of suitable heuristics to assess data quality
- automatic counting of cars, two-wheelers, and pedestrians passing the intersection in each direction
- interactive visualization of the dataset

This interactive report aims to present not only the outcomes of our analysis but also the complete process of exploring, processing, and analyzing the data. Our results are fully reproducible, and all steps can be applied to other similar datasets.
